        # Have a freq count for the target string, and also a freq count for the current window. We shrink and expand the window only when we meet all the target freq/conditions (so when the freq count of each characters match exactly). 

        # 1. Preprocess target: Build a frequency map (target) for string t.
        # 2. Expand right pointer: Iterate through s, adding characters to the window map.
        # 3. Check validity: If a characterâ€™s count in window matches target, increase have.
        # 4. Shrink left pointer: When all requirements are satisfied (have == need), try moving left forward to minimize the window, updating the best result if smaller.
        # 5. Update result: Keep track of the minimum-length valid window seen.
        # 6. Return slice: Extract substring from s using stored indices.
